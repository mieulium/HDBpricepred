# Capstone - HDB Price Prediction

This project is a part of the curriculum for General Assembly Data Science Immersive.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Problem/Objective
As the most Singaporeans first make their first big purchase when they buy their first HDB flat. This project aims to find out what are the predictors of resale HDB flats so that we can better prepare ourselves to buy a HDB of choice.

Likewise, we also hope to use the prediction to see if the price we are paying for a HDB is reasonable.
